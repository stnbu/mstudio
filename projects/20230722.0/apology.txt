oh hi there.

I have not found, still, a audio-video editing tool that I can stand to use. My goal is to be able to put media files in a directory, write a very short Python script and then get a nicely polished video as output.

And for my money Moviepy fits the bill. Its pieces are just the right size to allow plenty of freedom and still be productive without being overly verbose.

And I discovered as I always do that it's way harder than you think at first.

Anything!

I for one never ever learn that lesson.

So every quick "next step" has taking longer than I forecasted.

And therefor: long time/no video

I broke my iPhone front camera and so I'm limping along on the back camera which, yes, it is very awkward.

So the the quality is extra crap.

This was supposed to be a quick video to chuck on the timeline while at the same time polishing tools for the big-er project that looms still.

Now I possess many good pieces and expect to go quick-er on that.

One byproduct of the big-er project is a clip of the "silence" extracted from a long monologue I recorded.

I listened to it and it's gross!

It's too good to waste so I have folded it, letting you listen to multiple parts of it in parallel.

It's like you're in an elevator with a bunch of mouth breathers, no?

So, other than some stuff that I have laying around and some clips of Lily and I walking, with datestamps, this is by no means intended to be "quality" or "entertaining".

Here comes numerous pictures of Lily's precious bony little butt over which I refused to put these subtitles.

Enjoybers.
